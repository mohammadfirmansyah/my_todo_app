## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin contributing, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK** (version 3.0.0 or higher)
  - Check your Flutter version: `flutter --version`
  - Update Flutter if needed: `flutter upgrade`
- **Git** (for version control)
  - Check Git installation: `git --version`
- **IDE** - One of the following:
  - Android Studio with Flutter plugin
  - Visual Studio Code with Flutter extension
  - IntelliJ IDEA with Flutter plugin
- **Dart SDK** (comes bundled with Flutter)

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the repository** by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page

2. **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my_todo_app.git
   cd my_todo_app
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote** to keep your fork synchronized:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/my_todo_app.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Verify your setup** by running the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

### Create a Feature Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- `fix/bug-description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - For documentation changes
- `refactor/code-improvement` - For code refactoring
- `test/test-addition` - For adding tests

### Make Changes and Test

1. **Make your changes** to the codebase

2. **Test your changes thoroughly** before submitting:
   ```bash
   # Run the app
   flutter run -d chrome

   # Run tests (if available)
   flutter test

   # Check for any analysis issues
   flutter analyze
   ```

3. **Format your code** to follow Dart conventions:
   ```bash
   dart format .
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style Rules

- **Follow Dart conventions** as outlined in the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guide
- **Use meaningful variable and function names** that clearly describe their purpose
- **Keep functions small and focused** - each function should do one thing well
- **Use proper indentation** (2 spaces for Dart/Flutter code)
- **Avoid deeply nested code** - prefer early returns and guard clauses
- **Use const constructors** where possible for better performance

### Comment Style

All code comments must be written in **English** with a tutorial-style approach:

- **Educational approach**: Explain concepts clearly and scientifically
- **Clarity**: Describe the purpose and benefits of each code section
- **Brevity**: Keep comments concise - avoid over-explaining obvious code
- **Language**: Always use English for comments

**Example of good comments:**

```dart
// Initialize the todo list from local storage
// This ensures todos persist across app restarts
void _loadTodos() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  final todosJson = prefs.getStringList('todos') ?? [];

  // Parse JSON strings back into Todo objects
  setState(() {
    _todos = todosJson.map((json) => Todo.fromJson(json)).toList();
  });
}
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Test your changes** before submitting a Pull Request
- **Verify the app works** on at least one platform (web, mobile, or desktop)
- **Check for console errors** during runtime
- **Test edge cases** - empty states, invalid input, network errors, etc.
- **Ensure existing features** still work after your changes

### Breaking Changes

- **Do not introduce breaking changes** without prior discussion
- If a breaking change is necessary:
  - Open an issue first to discuss the change
  - Document the breaking change clearly in your PR
  - Provide migration instructions if applicable

## Submitting Changes

### Git Workflow

1. **Stage your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add dark mode support"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve todo deletion bug"
   ```

   **Commit message format:**
   - `feat:` - New feature
   - `fix:` - Bug fix
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Adding tests
