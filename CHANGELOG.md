### Fixed

- **Type Conversion Error in Todo.fromJson** (commit: dbbcc31) - CRITICAL
  - Fixed: `TypeError: type 'int' is not a subtype of type 'bool'`
  - Issue: Backend API returns `completed` field as int (0/1) instead of bool
  - Solution: Proper type conversion using comparison operators that return bool type
  - Changed: `completed: json['completed'] as bool,`
  - To: `completed: json["completed"] == true || json["completed"] == 1,`
  - Impact: Enables seamless integration with APIs returning different data types

- **Type Mismatch Error in Checkbox Widget** (commit: ea764bf)
  - Fixed: `TypeError: type 'int' is not a subtype of type 'bool'` at runtime
  - Issue: Checkbox widget receiving int instead of bool for `value` parameter
  - Solution: Proper type conversion in widget rendering

- **CardTheme Type Migration** (commit: 0a9bdd1)
  - Fixed: `The argument type 'CardTheme' can't be assigned to parameter type 'CardThemeData?'`
  - Issue: Flutter API changed from CardTheme to CardThemeData
  - Solution: Updated theme configuration to use CardThemeData

- **Deprecation Warnings - withOpacity()** (commit: 0a9bdd1)
  - Fixed: 5 deprecation warnings about `withOpacity()` method
  - Issue: Flutter deprecated withOpacity() for color transparency
  - Solution: Replaced all `.withOpacity(VALUE)` calls with `.withValues(alpha: VALUE)`

### Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter v3.9.2+
- **Language**: Dart v3.9.2+
- **UI Framework**: Material Design 3
- **Real-time Sync**: Socket.IO v2.0.3+1
- **HTTP Client**: http v1.2.0
- **Date Formatting**: intl v0.19.0
- **Platforms Supported**: Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux

### Database Integration

- **Backend**: ltsqj-crud_todo_sqlite (Node.js/Express with SQLite)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - GET /todos - Fetch all todos
  - POST /todos - Create new todo
  - PUT /todos/:id - Update todo
  - DELETE /todos/:id - Delete todo
  - Socket.IO: 'todos-updated' event for real-time synchronization

### Code Quality

- ✅ flutter analyze: 0 issues
- ✅ No deprecation warnings
- ✅ Proper null safety
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Tutorial-style code comments in English
- ✅ Resource cleanup in dispose() method
- ✅ Production-ready code

### Known Limitations

- Remote server connection may timeout if server is unreachable
- Socket.IO requires WebSocket support on backend
- Debug logs are limited to last 50 entries (memory optimization)

## Development Notes

### Architecture Pattern
- **State Management**: StatefulWidget with local state
- **Data Models**: Todo class with JSON serialization
- **API Integration**: RESTful HTTP client with Socket.IO real-time sync
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error dialogs
- **Logging**: Comprehensive debug logging system with timestamps

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test with local server at http://localhost:3000
2. Test CRUD operations for each todo state
3. Verify real-time sync with multiple clients
4. Test server switching without app rebuild
5. Verify error handling with network disconnection scenarios

### Future Enhancements
- Persist todo list to local storage
- Add todo categories/tags
- Implement todo search and filtering
- Add due date and priority features
- Multi-user collaboration with user authentication
- Offline-first synchronization strategy
